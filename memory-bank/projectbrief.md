# Project Brief

## Project Goal

Develop a robust and scalable financial API ("Okane Finance API") that provides users with a range of tools for market analysis, trading signal generation, and strategy backtesting.

## Core Requirements

*   **Real-time Data:** Fetch and process real-time stock market data (prices, news, etc.) from sources like Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage.
*   **News Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze news articles and provide sentiment scores for specific tickers.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Calculate various technical indicators (EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands).
*   **Signal Generation:** Generate trading signals based on configurable strategies and parameters.
*   **Backtesting:** Allow users to backtest trading strategies using historical data.
*   **AI Chatbot:** Provide an AI-powered chatbot for user interaction and market inquiries.
*   **Notifications:** Send notifications (e.g., via Discord, LINE) for trading signals.
*   **API Endpoints:** Expose well-defined API endpoints for all functionalities.
* **Authentication:** Implement basic authentication to secure the API.

**Constraints:**

*   Reliance on third-party APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.) for data.  Need to handle potential API rate limits and outages.
*   The accuracy of signals and backtesting results depends on the quality of historical data and the chosen strategies.

## Target Audience

*   Individual investors and traders (both novice and experienced).
*   Quantitative traders and developers.
*   Financial analysts and researchers.

## Success Metrics

*   **API Uptime and Reliability:**  Maintain high API availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
*   **User Adoption:** Track the number of active users and API requests.
*   **Accuracy of Signals:** Measure the historical performance of generated signals (e.g., win rate, profit factor).
*   **Backtesting Usage:** Monitor how frequently users utilize the backtesting functionality.
*   **User Feedback:** Collect and analyze user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

*   API Response Time
*   Number of Active Users
*   Signal Generation Frequency
*   Backtesting Requests per Day
*   User Satisfaction Score (from surveys/feedback)
