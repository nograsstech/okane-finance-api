# Product Context

## Project Vision

To create a comprehensive financial analysis and trading assistance platform ("Okane Finance API") that provides users with real-time market data, AI-powered insights, trading signals, and backtesting capabilities. The platform aims to empower both novice and experienced traders with tools to make informed decisions and potentially automate aspects of their trading strategies.

## Problem Statement

Individual investors and traders often lack access to the sophisticated tools and real-time data analysis capabilities available to large financial institutions. Existing solutions may be expensive, complex, or lack the specific combination of features needed for effective decision-making.  There's a need for an accessible, integrated platform that combines news sentiment analysis, AI-driven recommendations, technical indicators, and robust backtesting.

## User Stories

*   As an experienced trader, I want to backtest different trading strategies using historical data so that I can optimize my approach and minimize risk.
*   As a day trader, I want to receive real-time trading signals based on technical indicators so that I can quickly react to market changes.
*   As a quantitative trader, I want to define custom trading strategies and parameters so that I can automate my trading process.
*   As a user, I want to interact with a financial chatbot to get quick answers to my market-related questions so that I can save time on research.
* As a user, I want to receive notifications on Discord or LINE about trading signals, so that I don't miss opportunities.

## User Experience Goals
