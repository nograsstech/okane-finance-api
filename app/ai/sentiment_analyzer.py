The overall sentiment score from Alpha Vantage typically ranges from -1 to 1. This scoring system is designed to quantify the sentiment expressed in qualitative data, such as financial news or social media comments, providing a clear indication of market sentiment.

Sentiment Score Range and Interpretation
-1: Represents the highest level of negative sentiment. This indicates strong disapproval or pessimism regarding the subject matter.

0: Indicates a neutral sentiment, suggesting that the opinions are balanced between positive and negative or that there is no significant emotional charge.

1: Denotes the highest level of positive sentiment, reflecting strong approval or optimism about the subject matter.

Meaning of Scores
Negative Scores (-1 to 0): Suggest a general trend of negativity or concern among respondents. For example, a score of -0.5 would indicate a moderate level of negative sentiment.

Neutral Scores (around 0): Imply that the sentiment is neither positive nor negative, which can occur when opinions are mixed or when there is a lack of strong feelings about the subject.

Positive Scores (0 to 1): Indicate approval and optimism. A score of 0.7 would suggest a strong positive sentiment.
